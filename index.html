<p align="justify">
    I am a Ph.D. Candidate and a Google DeepMind Scholar at Istanbul Technical University, Computer Engineering Department. I am also a member of <a href="https://vision.itu.edu.tr/">ITU Vision Lab</a> at Istanbul Technical University. My research interests encompass a strong focus on Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision. Within these domains, I am particularly captivated by discrete representation learning for image generation.

    Prior to my current pursuit, I earned my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Engineering from Istanbul Technical University in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Notably, I accomplished my B.Sc. degree with a second-ranking, a testament to my dedication and commitment to academic excellence. During my M.Sc., I worked as a Research and Teaching Assistant at Istanbul Technical University, a role that enriched my experience on teaching and broadened my understanding of Computer Engineering subjects. Throughout this period, my research endeavors were centered around self-supervised GANs and their innovative applications in image generation.

    My personal interests include watching anime, reading manga, playing board games, and doing pilates. Anime and manga have been a significant part of my life, captivating me with their intricate storylines and compelling characters. I enjoy delving into diverse genres and exploring the creativity of the medium. Playing board games allows me to engage in strategic thinking and friendly competition, making for enjoyable social experiences. Additionally, I find solace in practicing pilates, where I can focus on wellness, flexibility, and mental relaxation. These interests enrich my life and provide a balanced escape from the demands of daily routine.
